# EDMC-Copilot

EDMC-Copilot is a plugin for [Elite Dangerous Market Connector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki). It will help you follow a route generated by the awesome [Spansh Galaxy Plotter](https://www.spansh.co.uk/exact-plotter) without having to alt-tab out of the game to select your next destination.

EDMC-Copilot will monitor your progress along the route, help you with HUD messages thanks to [EDMC Overlay](https://github.com/inorton/EDMCOverlay), and automatically copy your next destination to the clipboard. This way, you only need to access the galaxy map in-game to paste the destination. This saves time on long trips, and avoids breaking immersion.

# Installation

- Download and install [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Installation-&-Setup)
- Download and install [EDMC Overlay](https://github.com/inorton/EDMCOverlay)
- Download a [zipped copy of EDMC Copilot](https://github.com/jyannick/EDMC-Copilot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it to EDMC Plugins directory (should be `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EDMarketConnector\plugins`, alternatively from the EDMC interface select File->Settings, then switch to the `plugins` tab then `open`). Make sure it is located in a subdirectory, typically `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EDMarketConnector\plugins\EDMC-Copilot`

# Usage

- Plot a course using [Spansh Galaxy Plotter](https://www.spansh.co.uk/exact-plotter). To do so you will need a JSON of your ship build: there are many tools that can generate them. If you are using [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net) you can access `My fleet` page, then `See ship details` and click on the **Coriolis** link. Once in Coriolis, give your build a name using the text field in the top-right corner, save the build, then click on `export`. You can now copy-paste the JSON into Spansh.
- Once the plotter has found a route, save it in CSV format, and put it in the plugin directory, overwriting the provided `route.csv` file.
- Now start the game, start EDMC, and just follow the on-screen instructions ! When EDMC-Copilot displays a message indicating your next waypoint, the waypoint is automatically copied to the clipboard. Just access the galaxy map in-game, go to the text field, and press Ctrl-V.

# Troubleshooting

EDMC Overlay can be a bit tricky to get to work. First, make sure you have set up Elite in `borderless window` mode, and NOT `fullscreen` mode.

If you still don't see the overlay, you can try this procedure. On my computer it works every time:
- start Elite (the game proper, not just the launcher) and alt-tab back to windows
- navigate to the EDMC Overlay folder (should be C:\Users\<your login>\AppData\Local\EDMarketConnector\plugins\EDMCOverlay)
- launch EDMCoverlay.exe
- launch EDMC itself
- alt-tab back to the game. The EDMCoverlay welcome message should appear
